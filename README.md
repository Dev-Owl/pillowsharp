## Description
Pillowsharp is a library that makes the use of [Apache CouchDB](https://github.com/apache/couchdb) usage in .NET Core projects quite easy. The goal is to offer something that can be used out of the box without the need for configuration or a lot of code. Another idea behind Pillowsharp is the usage of async feature of .NET Core to ensure an easy an none blocking usage of all requests.
