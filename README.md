## Description
Pillowsharp is a libary that makes the use of Apache CouchDB usage in .NET Core projects quite easy. The goal is to offer something that can be used out of the box without the need for configuration or a lot of code.
Another idea behind Pillowsharp is the usage of async feature of .NET Core to ensure a easy an none blocking usage of all requests.
